# Git Workflow


Begin work...
1. If beginning a new project, create a new branch (name to match assignment) `git checkout -b new_branch`
2. Else, pull from relevant branch with `git pull`
3. While working, make frequent commits to track added features `git add , git commit `
4. Every couple hours, pull from the remote repository for that branch, then push your work `git pull , git push `
5. When you are finished working, pull from the remote repository, then push. Comment on your commit in Github to indicate tasks completed in that session and any outstanding tasks `git pull, git push`
6. Finally when the project is ready to publish, repeat step 5 then issue a pull request to the master branch
